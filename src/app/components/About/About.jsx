      <h2>About me</h2>
      <p>
        I'm an Information Systems student at the Federal University of
        Uberl√¢ndia (UFU), with a strong interest in Back-end development. I have
        experience in building RESTful APIs using Java and Spring Boot, as well
        as proficiency in creating dynamic, responsive, and modern interfaces
        with React.js.
      </p>
      <p>
        Currently, I am part of a Scientific Initiation project, where I develop
        an interactive dashboard and RESTful APIs that provide data for the
        analysis and monitoring of cybersecurity threats, enabling proactive
        decision-making by professionals in the field. In this project, I work
        with technologies such as Java, Spring Boot, PostgreSQL, JavaScript, and
        React. Additionally, as an active member of PET-SI, I contribute to
        academic initiatives in teaching, research, and community outreach,
        organizing and leading workshops, tutoring sessions, tech events,
        lectures, and preparatory courses for high-dropout subjects.
